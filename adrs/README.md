Here, you will find Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) written using the [Michael Nygard template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard). ADRs, in general, are a useful way to organize and document meaningful architecture decisions for posterity. In addition to documenting what specific decisions were made, ADRs aim primarily to document context - the why - as this is often more useful when understanding how software works. While many ADR templates will work to achieve this end, Michael Nygard's template has been chosen as it is simple and perhaps the most widely used template. It is important to remember that the decisions in ADRs are not "final" and can be ammended in the future should the need arise - ADRs serve only as a means to document why a decision was made at the time it was made.
