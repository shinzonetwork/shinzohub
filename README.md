**Shinzohub** is the trustless backbone of a decentralized ecosystem for blockchain data access.

It connects developers, indexers, and nodes through a seamless coordination layer:

- Developers register **Views** using familiar EVM-compatible smart contracts  
- Indexers listen for events and store structured data in **DefraDB**  
- Nodes track **outpost contracts** on chains like Ethereum and Solana, mirroring paid access through equivalent transactions

By combining smart contract signals, cross-chain observability, and on-chain accountability, Shinzohub acts as a connective hub between data creators, consumers, and verifiersâ€”without needing a central authority.
