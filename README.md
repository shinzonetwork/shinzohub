Shinzohub is the trustless backbone of an ecosystem for decentralized blockchain data access.

It brings together developers, indexers, and nodes in a seamless coordination layer. Developers register Views using familiar EVM-compatible smart contracts. Indexers observe on-chain events and persist the resulting structured data to DefraDB. Meanwhile, nodes follow outpost contracts on external chains like Ethereum and Solana, mirroring access payments through equivalent transactions.

By combining smart contract signals, cross-chain observability, and on-chain accountability, Shinzohub acts as the connective hub between data creators, consumers, and verifiersâ€”without needing a central authority.
